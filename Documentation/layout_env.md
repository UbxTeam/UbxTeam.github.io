title: Layout and Environment Variables
---

This document describes the default layout suggested for the installation and used by ubx_tools.
A set of environment variables is listed below, referring to the installation layout.
Remember that it is not necessary to install the Ubx software because it is possible to run it locally.

<font size="4" color="#0066FF"><b>NOTE:</b></font>The goal of Microblx is not to impose a particular layout. Feel free to change it, and have your own. We just propose a possible solution as starting point, because we found it handy to have a common starting point. Furthermore, several projects about software distribution exist out there and we don't want to re-invent the wheel.

<font size="4" color="#CC0000"><b>NOTE:</b></font>The Environment Variables mentioned here may be subject to changes in the near future. Please check this page often to see if any change has been applied.


## Installation Layout

Given a desidered installation folder ```<install-path>```, Ubx can be installed as follow:

    | ~<install-path>
    | - /bin
    | - /include
    | | - ubx/
    |   | - types/
    |
    | - /lib
    | | - ubx/
    |   | - blocks/
    |   | - types/
    |
    | - /share
    | | - ubx/
    |   | - cmake/
    |   | - templates/
    |   | - models/
    |   | - metamodels/
    |   | - scripts/
    
### Folders description

| Folder | Contains |
| -------------|----------------|
| /bin    | generated executable ubx applications and symlinks to executable scripts) |
| /include/ubx | type headers (needed only for dev-purpose)| 
| /lib/ubx/types | Type-only modules | 
| /lib/ubx/blocks | Blocks-only modules | 
| /share/ubx/cmake | CMake modules (to find dependencies) | 
| /share/ubx/templates | Templates for code generation | 
| /share/ubx/models | Block models (.blx) of implemented blocks |
| /share/ubx/metamodels | Metamodels specifications |
| /share/ubx/scripts | (Lua) scripts and modules |

## Environment Variables

|  Var. Name    |   Description  | Default |
| -------------|----------------|----------------|
| UBX_ROOT  | Points to Microblx root repository folder | ```$ export UBX_ROOT=<ubx-core>``` |
| UBX_INSTALL  | Points to install root folder | ```$ export UBX_INSTALL=<install-path>``` |
| UBX_MODULES  | -> lib/ubx | ```$ export UBX_MODULES=$UBX_INSTALL/lib/ubx```|
| UBX_MODELS   | -> share/ubx/models | ```$ export UBX_MODELS=$UBX_INSTALL/share/ubx/models```|
| UBX_METAMODELS | -> share/ubx/metamodels |  ```$ export UBX_METAMODELS=$UBX_INSTALL/share/ubx/metamodels```|

___NOTE:___ Most of the environment variables can be deduced from ```UBX_INSTALL```. However, this allows to override a default option, while keeping the others.

___NOTE (2):___ In the future, these Environment Variables will be treated as list of paths!

## Environment Settings

The following Environment are system-dependent and they must be setup properly

|  Var. Name    |   Description  | Default |
| -------------|----------------|----------------|
| PATH  | Add to this the /bin folder(s) | ```$ export PATH=$PATH:<install-path>/bin``` |
| LUA_PATH  | Add /script folder from both installation and Ubx core | ```$ export LUA_PATH=";;;$LUA_PATH:<install-path>/share/ubx/scripts/?.lua;<ubx-core>/lua/?.lua``` |
| CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH | Add /cmake folder to find cmake modules | ```$ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:$UBX_ROOT/share/ubx/cmake``` |
